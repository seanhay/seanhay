- 👋 Hi, I’m @seanhay
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, cats, design, and photography
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make nice Markup documents, Tailwind, Vue.js, and always trying to update what I know
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything
- 📫 I can be reached at sean(at)seanhay.com

I'll update this a bit later to make it look nicer...
